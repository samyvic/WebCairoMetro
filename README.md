# WebCairoMetro

Cairo Metro is the nerve of the transportation means in Egypt. 
It carries nearly 4 million passengers a day, according to the statistics from the Egyptian company for Metro management & operation in 2021.
The rush-hour is unpleasant for passengers on public transport. The negative impact that may affect the passengers is due to two common reasons:
1. Crowd: in front of the ticket window
2. Long Queue Time: waiting to buy a ticket

## The Proposed Solution
An Integrated System composed of a mobile application that help users buying tickets and a web application to allow the management to track tickets, show reports. <br>
The web application is presented in this repo.
